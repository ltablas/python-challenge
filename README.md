# python-challenge

In this week's challenge there are two activities: PyBank and PyPoll. Each activity has its own folder. Within each folder, the Resources folder contains the raw data csv file used for the analysis. The main.py code analyzes the csv file and prints the results both in the terminal and in a txt file contained within the Analysis folder.
